Game Jam - Pencil Chisel Code Entry 2022

This is a small game our small team made for the **Game Jam Pencil Chisel Game 2022** hosted on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/pencil-chisel-code-2/entries), using MonoGame.

It is a chill game where the objective is keeping your companion safe and comfy, by lighting bonfires and feeding them berries! 
Your companion is scared of The Darkness, getting more and more anxious the farther away they are from you or a fire. You can collect twigs to start a fire or keep the fire burning, however you can't stay at one bonfire or place for too long because The Darkness is after you.

To start a fire you need to have 10 twigs in your inventory and for keeping the fire burning (for a bit more) you need to use 2 twigs. Picking up berries from bushes and feeding them to the companion will make the companion more happy and comfortable.

***

* Use `WASD` to move around
* Use `E` to pickup twigs and berries
* Use `F` to keep the fire burning (needs at least 2 twigs) or feed the companion
